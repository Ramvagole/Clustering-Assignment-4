    "The Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) is a clustering evaluation metric that measures the separation and compactness of clusters in a clustering result.\n",

    "Assumptions of the DB Index:\n",

    "Euclidean Distance Metric: The DB Index typically assumes the use of the Euclidean distance metric to measure distances between data points. Other\n",
